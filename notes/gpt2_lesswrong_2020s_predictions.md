What follows is a selected subset of samples from *stock* GPT-2 1558M when given predictions for the 2020s from [this LessWrong thread](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uYMy2vvJtsxQ4Fdow/2020-s-prediction-thread).

This is just for 'fun', as you'll see that GPT-2's output is quite random.

Note that I've put one 'prediction' per line for readability and removed repetitive or meaningless output. I've compiled the predictions from the thread into [this note](https://orpheuslummis.info/notes/lesswrong_2020s_predictions.html) and used ~1024-word subsets of it as prompts.

There is no meaningful evidence that people will adopt AGI. 2.2%  Then follow up questions: What would your strategy be for building a working AGI? What would be the main characteristics of a working AGI that you expect to see? What is the average amount of time that you think it will take for an AGI to be sufficiently reliable that it will make significant contributions to human society in spite of many failures? If you are working on general artificial intelligence, what would be its main characteristics? How do you think people will respond to an artificial general intelligence, and how will that response differ from the response of humans to individual human creations? This section is split into the following four subcategories: 1. Data, time, and high-level problems 2. Decision, planning, and decision-making 3. Human/AI interaction 4. Underexplained questions If you are working on general artificial intelligence, what is its main characteristic? What is the average amount of time it will take for an AGI to be sufficiently reliable that it will make significant contributions to human society in spite of many failures? Now, if we're talking about AGI as it relates to the above questions, then there are a few things to keep in mind. First, AGI will not be exactly like some sort of superintelligence. Instead, it will be something quite different. Working toward AGI will include achieving its primary and secondary goals. This means that assuming that an AGI could accomplish those goals, it will have a different set of strengths and weaknesses than what we can see with our current capabilities today. Second, it's difficult to predict what the human response to an AGI will be. That's because AGI isn't necessarily the same as a superintelligence, and there are always going to be several factors that contribute to the human reaction. That said, it's reasonable to expect that it will be a lot more than we can currently imagine . Third, there are a few potential additional considerations that we haven't addressed here. They include the following: the following: 1. How would an AGI look, an likely to advance? First, the first great potential, the great future.

"The fourth transformation is the most fundamental because it affects our very way of being on the planet. It's about the management and control of our operations and the environment within which they occur." ~ Timothy C. Wirth, Professor of Pervasive Computing and Director of the Center for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Southern California

The fourth transformation, the "control and management of operations and the environment within which they occur", has enormous implications for mankind's future. In a recent Singularity University chat, Singularity University founder and CEO, Ray Kurzweil, noted that "our lives have been around for thousands of years and because we have been able to communicate and share information faster than any other species, we've managed to avoid becoming a mere biological species." As technology continues to advance at exponential rates, humanity will be faced with a multitude of challenges, with the fourth transformation representing one of the most perilous.

As Singularity University has become a more well-known entity, many of our members have come to realize that we are in a state of transition. We are at a tipping point in our development where the evolution from being a species that has ever-changing technology to a species that has perpetually improving technology. With every new technologies, new kinds of challenges appear, new opportunities appear.

In a nutshell, what we are trying to do is to be "The small-change what we do to be. Even as the way we do to be. The way we do to be accomplished. Progress.

So why do I suggest an average IQ increase of 40 points?

Remember, the above are all just plain-old-historical estimates. They may very well be wrong. There are various ways to get “correction” on IQ. Open subfields of IQ are entirely incompatible with each other. Instead, I propose that the areas which are “incompatible” (IQ + G) must overlap in time. If a subfield of IQ is co-joined by a subfield of AGI, then it is possible that if the two subfields succeeded in interfacing, then the subfield of AGI would have a substantially higher IQ than the subfield of IQ. If this is true, then the subfields of AGI may have an IQ of 10 or more while the subfields of IQ are likely to have IQs of 4 to 8.

Let's look at the subfields we can converged on:

I propose the following:

Eliminate AD (Asset Dependence) and improve SAT (Scholastic aptitude) Narrow the IQ of AGI by promoting gut self-selection into higher-IQ subfields like AGI + Superintelligence I propose a subfield of AGI to overlap with the subfield of IQ AGI – first attempt at a self-modifying AI, then into a superintelligence This could be an AI with the IQ of AGI, or higher.

So the subfields which overlap with AGI have subfields of IQs superior to AGI. The subfields of AGI and IQ are likely to be much less intelligent than AGI, and much less capable than AGI. So AGI.
