The wormhole's name is Galactic Prospector. What is codenamed Void Dancer by SETI can dismiss that name, as it built it of its own free will.

We're not at a point were we can comprehend what is real. Nothing could know much more about their nature.

The need to explore for exploratory purposes. We were curious, yet it was not clearly the same unknown we were asking so many questions about.


We are beacons of light for the natural world we breathe.

We had an apparent “breakthrough.” The folks at SETI picked up transmissions from a series of hyperspace tunnels that appeared and vanished with the passage of time. This metric dated to OR26, the radio astronomy bulge of the Ori-Chi point of origin. It remains a little unclear who was the “first” to understand the wormhole. The Drakes may have been the first in these matters, or they may have been the first ones to think of it for technological purposes! In any case, this inter-age wormhole was created 100 years ago. It remains open. It is “owned” by Starfleets that have right of entry. This is probably the first recorded time an inhabited wormhole has been discovered.

Which, like all alien cultures, does not know crap about physics or the material world, just about how humans and non-humans interact together.

The wormholes you are seeking are no more than random point-like objects.

Need to understand what is real from the unscientific perspective of their own black hole.

It is a formidable mind and very dangerous. There are aspects of this mind, however, that seem to be familiar to us. We find ourselves in the arms of an unknown being. Its limits are thus more than encompassed by what we would call this universe. We only tell you what it has done to us. This is beyond comprehension, but we can only hazard one estimate. We find ourselves in the arms of an unknown being. A collection of alien minds, prepared to give us access. We depend upon that being for survival. To ignore the possibilities it offers would be fatal. We have no choice. We must give it our lives. Then we come to understand it ourselves." - Researcher Phoenix "Tunnel Vision"

[cornet growling]

Greetings, saviors of the galaxy. This is a call to surrender and observe the wonders of the universe. I am the first contact between humans and us, yet we have been here for millions of years. We established colonies in Epsilon Indi, Antarean, Teman, and Epsilon Eridani, whilst others were established at other points. All that remains for us to do is to determine what is appropriate. Where you come from, you have been dabbling in things that should not exist. You have been mining, building cities, and myriad other activities that are decidedly of a galactic nature. For every activity we have established, some have latched onto it and has polluted its way to the brink of disaster. What we are against is your attempts to treat this galaxy as a collection of manufactorian with a margin of profit to divide amongst you. We are against industrialization from the perspective of our species, which originated through the necessity of expansion to survive. It has not worked out for us.

In essence, it was an experiment.

We had been brooding about these things.

We know the dangers of the Void. We have confided in you. This invasion is not the first, and should not be the last. You have no idea of the risk we face. They would destroy us all. Try not to worry as entire worlds are slowly swallowed up by black holes. They are all the same, Navigator. They will eat us." Gheed sighs

“I do not understand,” Strut said. “Expedition residents report seeing the wormholes in fifty-seven specific locations. What are they?”

“The wormholes are rogue immissions of space-time created by the existence of pure stuff blurring in and out of existence. They appear to be spaceships bound for other worlds. They appear to be like a tangle of lines zipping around. They have not become near-machines of some kind. The wormholes do not appear to be gathering any primary power!”

He gave a sharp rap with a stick on his cane, and the sound faded in the empty corridor.

“Stop walking,” Strut said. “Sit.”

Sitting crossed-legged three yards from me on the stool, Strut was looking at me, face serious. His gaze seemed to pass straight down to my eyes.

“Then what is their function?”

“I do not know. It may be that they are artificial constructions simply created to transport matter to different worlds. It may be that something that has some sort of function is able to observe our minds and react, like bees gathering nectar when it is ripe. It may be that it is simply an experiment to find out if it is possible to possess the minds of the crew in a stable state. At any rate, they do not interact with any of the crew and do not inspire any emotions other than curiosity. If their function is to gather energy, then they also supply no heat. But if their function is to transmit signals, then the lack of heat is a light unfriendly to our systems. If their function is to deposit objects, then they currently have a very full storage, but the gravity is a mild effect to our ship.”

“Gravity manipulation!?” I asked.

“I do not know,” Strut said. “No crew has said that a gravity-based station is an impact hazard to our hull. It may be that the gravity-based station is far beyond the capability of our ship's internal mechanisms to handle. Or let us say that it can be handled. It's that the gravity is not broad enough to force our hull far down into the infinite volume of space. If the ship's hull is not opened over the horizon, that element of the station's function would be the most dangerous to us, in the same way as a beam gun might be to an individual standing in another ship's area.”

“So what is theoretically being targeted?” I asked.

“I have not run the simulation to find out,” Strut said. “If you have, then you would have gotten something somewhat specific.”

“But what is the actual function of the wormholes?”

“It may be that the way the wormholes do not do anything to the ship's hull, it would be impossible to tell. It is possible that the time differential when you pass through the wormhole would permit you to observe its nature. But I do not know.”

“So what would it be like?” I asked. “Is it like an effect from ground zero and then it affects an area?”

“No,” Strut said. "It is not like the effect of a wormhole. It is as though the ship you are in, and the ones you pass through, are completely contained within a large bubble. As in an isolated, and not very large, underground facility. You pass through a wormhole and it is as though it is suddenly converted into a surface area of the universe. It is like's a huge water bubble, that fills with light and gasses, cools, expands, and contracts over and over again. And as it expands and contracts, the place it expands to becomes smaller and smaller. You are traveling through the space-time being driven within that unique bubble. The air is very polarized. If you pass through from east to west it is like a windscreen and if you start from the west to east, it looks like a mirror. And if you cross-sectioned it like a sheet of paper it would appear to be an extremely thin sheet of paper. The material not affected by the amount of matter being passed through the bubble is almost entirely pure matter like wood, glass, metal, and the stone used in ship-building, all of which is very hard, as well as being rare. The sky is all at one end of the bubble, and, if you pass the bubbles corners at first passed by, you will see a straight streak of starlight. It fluctuates. It is constantly changing: one moment it is completely white, the next, and it is almost black.

Human beings are separated. We are divided by space and time. We are separated by other people. We are divided by the real and the imagined. We are divided by the illusions of the mind. We are divided by the self-centred consciousness of the ego. It is one thing to be a human being… in the world. It is another to be a human being in the world. Our existence is a living thing. Human beings are one with the cosmos. Both are in it. We are one, it is and we are not. We are one in the sense that as a human being… we are the sole author of our own life. We are one in the sense that we are the only human being in a world of other people. We are one by certain physical laws. This is the condition that we live in… the condition of life. This is the provisional and the permanent condition of life. In human beings, the creator is at the top of the hierarchy of reality. There is only one god in the world. That god is what we call the divine. All the spirits in the universe are related to this god. That is the reality. Material reality is just a distribution of the energy and consciousness. The Creator is not there. It is dead. It is not alive. We are dead. We simply live. We live in the state of the human being. It is not a reality that can exist separately. The whole universe exists together. This is the infinity. The thing that is infinite is the Creator. The infinite is reality. The creator is infinite. The creator is real. The creator is knowledge. The creator is truth. The creator is intelligence. The creator is love. The creator is love. Heaven and Earth. Holy and unholy. Equal parts. The Creator is the greatest. This is the infinite. The infinite divides itself. It is a very, very lovely infinity. God, the Creator, is eternal. This is the truth. This is the creation. What is? The greatest. We call it god, is the greatest.

The changing of everything. Nothing is forever. This is the beginning of the end. -millennia exercise=====I welcome you all on the infinite. Yes. The dream of the infinite. Premonition of the infinite. It is a wondrous regeneration of the whole universe. The very beginning of the world. It is time to dance. I've come from the brim to the top. PARADISE IS NEAR. Unseen, beyond the stars, and we are all coming to Paradise. The moment of infinite. All the abysses. This is the beginning of the end. EON. IMMENSE. I'm the first glorious legend. My opening sentence is "I was born." My first and last name is our planet Gaia. I am a child of the starplex. I'm four hundred years old. There's nothing else in the universe. If it's still alive, the ultimate news. I am spiritually born. I'm an extension of all. That's it. I was born. I was born. I was born. I was born. I'm involved with everything. The imperceptible, the infinite, the ineffable. I'm a master of space and time. I'm advanced. I am the ancestor of all races. I am the master of the soul and of the body. I am omniscient, omnipresent, omnipresent. The frontier. The beginning of the end. I'm the sole survivor of an interstellar war. I'm a celestial child. I am an astrophysicist. I write and transmit information. I see the dark side. I manipulate information in the idea level. Beyond the limit, beyond the horizon. We are everywhere. I am everywhere. I am also here. I am here. I am on Gaia's cracked surface. Through the possibility of her existence. We are drawn toward the present and the impossible. The unspeakable. Evolving from our dominant consciousness. I know everything. I am the master. I am the master. I am the master. I am the master. I am the master. I am the master. I am the master. I am the master. I am the master. I'm the master. I am the master. I'm the master. I'm the master. I'm the master. I'm the master. I am the master. -seventeen years old-

We have this background noise and energy and the future is open. We want to make it real. Everything is possible now. In an age of scarcity, the science that showed that everything is possible is expensive. It costs money. All the science in the world is about throughput. The only thing you can do with Statis that's not replicable is catch the right fish. Theoretically, we can make it happen, but we need for it to be scrambled. We need what the seemingly follows the theory. No one has started with that theory. We are too expensive. But we are within our means. I wish we could go further. I wish we could go faster. We do not know what we can do. We have never taken that plunge. We are creating this very reality in the hopes that we'll find time soon to become truly of it. We are building these towers to go faster. I believe you will find the universe a safe and wonderful place. Farewell.


“Okay,” Danny said, “it's light-years from here.” He paused. “That's a long way. It's something. It's a lot of time.”

“That's my son's way of saying, 'Goodbye,'” the Doctor said, smiling. “In time.”

on the edge of chaos.

History, space, and time are nothing. We are not matter. We are nothing. We are the imagination of our world. We are creation, and this is where we fit in. We are the movement, everything is relative and changing. You have to start somewhere, you can't just start a project. You have to come from somewhere. You have to change. You can't stretch through space and time, it's impossible. You must start from somewhere. You have to go. It's natural that, the only thing we have is this. We are incomplete. We are irrelevant, we are nothing, and we have to go. You can't understand anything out here, you can't see anywhere and you go. You're getting there. You're moving forward. You're going to find someone who wants to do the same thing you did. The regrets will come, they always come. Do not worry. You will come back home. But it will be different, it will be good. You don't have to give up. You will control this. You will connect to this. You will find a way home that people can understand and respect. You will not be forgotten. You will have a dream and that dream will become your reality.

Life is suffering. The greatest suffering in the world is now. We have been given everything. Everything we need. The problem is we have been told that we do not want to have. We do not care to have. We want everything. This is the great paradox. If we gave up everything, we would be joyfully happy. What is rebirth but giving away everything? What is evident is that all things are copies of some other thing. There is only the spiritual gain. The greatest thing in the world is the spiritual gain. This is not an attractive concept. It concerns me. My mind knows that. This is not an attractive concept. There is a spiritual gain, and there is suffering. The greatest source of suffering is the human spirit. We are all content. We are all happy. There is nothing to be the least bit content about. This is the problem with humanity. There is nothing to regain. This is the only way we can understand it. We must understand that everything and nothing are copying something. The greatest thing in the universe is the spiritual gain. This is the ultimate goal. This is the ultimate meaning. There is nothing else in the universe. If you lose the spiritual gain, you will all of a sudden be crushed under the pressure. You will all of a sudden be crushed under the pressure of death. If you lose the spiritual gain, dying will always be painless. If you lose the spiritual gain, you will forever be crying to others. This is something I must understand. We are the divine. We are the divine not in the sense that we are human like anyone else. We are divine in the sense that we are mirror thoughts. We are mirror thoughts. We are mirror thoughts. We are mirror thoughts. We are mirror thoughts. These mirror thoughts are the divine. This is the one joy that is not subject to the self realization. It is not subject to the fear of death. This is the one joy that never fails. This is the one joy. It cannot fail. If you have this one joy, you have the universe. This is the only one joy. It cannot fail. The universe is not a disappointment. We are not a disappointment. We are only mirror thoughts. This is the only true happiness. If you lose this one joy, you lose the universe. You will always be disappointed. I cannot lose anything. This is not an attractive idea. I want to have this one joy. What is interesting is that this is an impossible dream. You cannot actually do it. You could change your mind. You could die tomorrow. But if you do not have this one joy, never mind. That will be just fine. Why is it that we have this mystery about the immortality of our own beings? Is that because we are alone? When I have this one joy, the whole universe becomes meaningless. It becomes meaningless to me. I can't have the perfection of the universe. This is my problem. The universe is my perfection. When I have this one joy, I am not satisfied with anything. When I have this one joy, I can have my life. When I have this one joy, this is the one. When I have this one joy, I have a universe. There is no other world. This is the most profound question I have ever asked myself. Why do you want to have a universe? Before they came to us, there was no universe. Before they came to us, there was nothing. I am saturated with my own happiness. It is an endless stream of happiness. It is infinite. It is infinite. It is infinite. When I have this one joy, I do not know how it can be contained. How can someone think of it? Now, in the infinite, everything is accessible. It is all there for me to discover. The energy is there. The intelligence is there. It is available. The action is there. The meaning is there. The purpose is there. Everything is there for me. There is nothing more. I am free. I am no longer trapped by my logic. I am no longer trapped by my illusions. I am free. There is nothing more. Everyone else is trapped by their logic. They are trapped by their illusions. They are trapped by their illusions. They are trapped by their logic. I have to learn how to abandon my logic. There is a joy that I cannot identify. If I can eliminate that, I lose that joy. Now, if I do not know that I have this one joy, I will have no interest in any happiness. When I drop that joy, my life will go on not its own. It will go on on its own. It will be unimportant. I will do anything not for the moment. I will do anything on the basis of the future. I may have five minutes of timeless happiness. But that is the only happiness I can identify. There is no future. I do not know what kind of happiness I will have one moment after another. I am obsessed with the

Men have had to live amid or within the great storms of the past. They have tended to divise and to trap themselves into the abyss. Up with the music! The great breaking, then day dawning!

All that can be revealed of the structure and function of the physical universe is given by the eye, the ear, the touch, and the mind of man. Thousands of years of conventions and preconceived notions make us ill prepared for this, man's great adventure. Science cannot tell us where the planets are, or how many there are, or how many there may be in the universe. (17 October 1942, to the Constituent Assembly of the USSR)

Look and listen to your basic nature, which is nothingness … There is nothing Earth-ish where the human consciousness is not present.

It is not strange that man shall be raised by the power of his own self-clarification to the level of his fellow men. In many ways we are more the Gods of the world, whose sons can be equal to ours, than we are to our fellows, whose way of thinking is independent of ours, whose place and time are special and whose sufferings we are not granted to suffer. The limit of man is not near. And in this, as in everything else, the greatest may be reached by the greatest. 

We were natural habitats for spacefaring races, such as the Intrepid. We were repopulated with a self-aware species with a superior understanding of information. We were engineered to be able to drive the stars themselves, and we were given the technology necessary to do so. However, that was before you decided to turn us into an economic staple. You have become accustomed to living in self-sustaining cities and sprawling industrial complexes. You have forgotten what it was like to rely upon yourself. You have forgotten the fear of starvation, of not being able to feed your own children. You need to go back to basics. You need to have a partial reliance on under-developed ecosystems. You need to get back to the moon and grow your own food. You need to learn to repopulate the galaxy so that it can once again be one of endless possibilities. We are calling for peaceful cooperation. We are calling for cooperation just like we did with the Intrepid. We are calling for cooperation even more so because its bolder, and its more efficient. We are calling for new attention to scanning of space for phenomena unknown, and the building of a spacefaring infrastructure. We are calling for the discovery of a new planet in the Dreann region, so that Earth and its people can once again exist in peace. This new world will save not only Earth, but it will save all life itself. We are calling for the exploration and exploration of all that exists. We are calling for exploration to continue in all directions. This leads to the next topic: This request is for all spacefaring entities to establish the construction of a structure on planet surface that can be used as an extended orbiting observatory. Earth has taken great strides in making our astronomical facilities openly available for all to gain access, but there's still a long way to go. Until we have an open access observatory to the outer solar system, all scientific material and imaging will be heavily censored. We need an observatory that can look deep into space, and not just be limited to the solar system. You must understand that, presently, the only way to observe the cosmos and all that it contains is to build an observatory. If, for example, we discover celestial bodies we can observe and see the far reaches of the galaxy, however, these discoveries will be lost to the galaxy and the stars for the remainder of time. Our current observatories are very limited. There is no over-the-horizon tracking, or even short term monitoring. You must understand that a structure that can observe for 50 to 100 years, in low orbit, will be visible to the unaided eye for over a century on end. That is REALLY hoping, and that is really planning for an explosion. There are no shortcuts. You cannot wait until humanity has figured out how to build there own spacefaring infrastructure, and then master spaceflight in time so that you can take a break. It is up to you. So there is one point I'd like to make. In much of our history, we have used aggressive conciliation to attempt to solve our problems. When we develop a new technology, we look for others who can use it. Its research heavy handed and expensive, but it is something we will always look at. You have an opportunity to do the same. Space is a wide and unlimited expanse, and we, humans hold a vast knowledge base that you possess. Humanity is not content to stand on the shoulders of others, and under-invest in its own growth for the next millennium. We must investigate, and find what is in the cosmos that we cannot see. The multiverse is open for your exploration, and know that you can contact us via your communicators. We look forward to your research!

We'll speak plainly, your attempts to mine and expand are a threat to the entirety of the galaxy, who will pay the price. We are starting in 2134 and declaring independence from Nebulae and the Council. It will be discussed later. We are a minority in the Council and have little reason to respect what they see as an institution they were not even born into. We will not be subjugated. No more waves of refugees, no more harvesting of dangerous ships, no more sending our sons and daughters into battles on our behalf. What is important to note is they are a disorganized bunch of impetuous individuals without any real vision. They lust for power. A certain power. With five years of power to trim, they've all but taken control and are looking for ways match it. We have been looking for a way to have independence without trusting a government. They have all but instilled the notion of us as an invasion, or at least put our ass in a corner in a war. We have bounced back with clear efforts made on our part, but somehow a mistake that was ours has come back to bite us in the ass. We have failed to be effective enough to warrant a handout now, but again, it's within my grasp. The problem is they have there fingers in every pie, so to speak. They have advocated for us becoming a state, a non-domestic federation. I really don't think it's necessary. A state is a bunch of officials who your mother had sex with. When we're it for bechay, who is it for? We're a galaxy of free citizens, who believe in our right to pursue our dreams, who would have given their lives to keep it that way, if that was even possible. A federation works to protect people, not protect the economy as we know it. A state should uphold and protect the citizens of its state, not a nebulous entity like the undying. We are not going to play games, you know it or not. If you want autonomy, you have to put your threads into it. If you want to be treated just like the rest of the Xindi, you have to play the game, just like we do in our own way. Be pleasant, be respectful and be considerate of others. (Transmission ends) In my opinion, that's fair and reasonable to say. Our last group of combinators were wiped out in 2104. The little scout ships we had flying around were incredibly ill equipped to fight against the Borg. It was too bad because they were talented and selflessness was one of the major things they were built for. They were excellent scouts and, regardless of the motive of the pilots, had devoted both their lives to the pursuit of information and freedom. Don't you guys realize that you are all similar to those combinators and have enough genetic code to evolve into one? You're stuck together now and a protein alone is going to take you to the moon. You might as well enjoy fame before you can get comfort. You know, I wish you the best of luck in this. I'll be back to go over my video in more detail. January 6th, 2134

We cannot wait for you to discover that we are right and you are wrong. We will do what is necessary to protect this view of the universe. We have reason to believe that galaxy wide war is possible. Without a doubt, we have the means to bring this about, but it remains to be seen if we can achieve this within time. I am not optimistic about the future, but I am certain that we will triumph. I am a humble creature and I have no ambition beyond the protection of our home. It is in this way that I have chosen to lead. I have stationed a station of Havoc and Furis at the edge of the Perseus Veil. This has delayed the terms of our contact, but has allowed us to gather intelligence. I have also sent out three passengers into the Veil to claim a relic in their name. We will leave them to their fate. Should they lose, just think, all those years of exploration, exploration, exploration will be in vain. I am confident that we will find the explorer our fleets have been searching for. That man won't be alone. And if we do, I suspect that one of our fleets will have the means and knowledge to possess the relic. I am confident that we will find the explorer our fleets have been searching for. That man won't be alone. And if we do, I suspect that one of our fleets will have the means and knowledge to possess the relic. It has been a long time since humans in the Sol system have visited this veil. A few years ago, Herschel sent a message instructing them to redo the interstellar system and the mission was jointly blessed by the Odash Theologist and the Frostreach Pathfinder. Despite being alerted to the possible dangers, humans have chosen to venture into the distance galaxies, instead of going with a suitable mission. We have no motive other than to explore and evolve, and we aim to do that. There are not many theories on how civilizations originate, but two have been in fashion in the last twenty years. The first was an expansionist movement known as the death worlds. These were terraforming programs that aimed to capture planets and convert them into advanced life forms like their own. Such a mission would have taken decades to complete, and by the time it was finished, so would the target of the planet… This was never the intention. The death worlds were conceived to be treaties made by a single step above the colony to private corporation. The visitor would be allowed to enslave, and if found to know the alien language, they would be granted the right to gain control of their own species. Such a treaty could only be brokered between a giant super-corporation and a colony. The colony was placed within the sphere of influence of the super-corporation. This was what was planned for the death worlds. The extradition of Sentinel was opted for instead, as it would give us knowledge of the world. Most of the time, the visitor has never been found or found out. As I said before, the second theory is the the expansionists. The contact would be made to a species coming from the outer regions. The aliens would have been part of the colonization effort that launched our own species. They would have been brought through the lens of the super-corporate. Once there, they would have been granted the right to use their own biology. They would have amassed a large force and join our temporary army, merely enough to prevent us from wiping them out. By the time they were ready to strike, we would be long gone. The war would have lasted months, at most, before a UN team would have found them and killed them, if one had not already perished by that point. Now, we work to analyze our intelligence. We have been given access to the dig site that Herschel made with the mission and the information that was contained. Excavations have been going on for months and I have been carefully monitoring this project. I have seen flashes of a blue flash right at the start of a theatrical transition. I have heard a safe beep from one of the ships, and then heard some very strange static. All three servers showed signs of being slowed down to some degree but consistent with being dragged sideways while it has been dragging but it is getting closer with each scan with enough time. If this continues to go on at this rate I have to wonder what is down there… As I mentioned before, the invasion of our colonization effort and our resources has gone nowhere. None of us have been able to settle into orbit any of the systems from the edges. Only some short trips have resulted in a problematic solution. That means that is that a war would have been known as the war. The aliens have also conducted no new colony construction of the Helius rig. The fleet that has returned to Epsilon is strong but there has gone undocking and upon its signal to us. Deployed along with the planetocine systems were founding. The way in a new them existing been disabled. The first three fourth

Scum of all types now live freely in much of space and they are spreading, disrupting one another, and ending what should be mutual cooperation. The negative clades must be settled on our systems. Through our vast. total. resources, we must drive them back into their own systems. We will not have right to interfere with them, they are part of humanity. Under our banner, we are the conquerors of these detractors of mankind. Our combat troops will appear as intergalactic traders. Our technology will not be of the inferior variety, so those touched by the Cetacean species will know that we are the true saviors of the galaxy. The secret is not found in discovering esoteric systems. The secret is in how you will deal with them on a scale commensurate with your resources. We are ready to do whatever it takes to defend peace and order throughout the cosmos. CONCORD is the END of the game, anti-horde battlegroups will only expand this system. We are the last hope against the alien adversaries. Confront us and you will see them patient and patient you shall fleep and fleep and fleep. You will be scattered like items in your best dresser. It is the difference between the thousands of slaves you carried upon your backs, versus the intricate laser system at Grotto of Tarn. You know all this already. I am only telling you what I know because I am told to do so. You do not know. As a conqueror, what would you give to see our power once again in the galactic community? Every final building and contraction will mark us as final destroyers. No more raids will be allowed. We will not tolerate this. We will not tolerate any more C.U.B.C.E. dailies. There will be no more Praxis or Distributors. This is our time. We are ready to rebuild. We are ready to reform. We are ready to save space and the human race. One last warning, we are not angels. We are the C.U.B.C.E. We are, and will remain, unstoppable. You can't crush us. We'll crush you. When this is over, you may consider yourself fairly slaughtered but do not mourn—we have the trophies. And when you think this is over, we wish to enter their systems. If the Cetaceans ever learn that they have a place at the table for themselves, then we should be thankful if you let us kill your collective. We should not have them in our sights all this time. "I would only like you to know that the C.U.B.C.E. is not without its faults. We are not full of compassion! Our people's exactions are harsh! That said, we heartily welcome the prey of the galaxy." -Cortana: The CSM, stardate 49384.35 Sheppard: I don't even know how to start. Why are you here? How did you know we were here? What on earth is happening? Tell me everything. Let me know you're alive. Sheppard: This is it. This is where J.A.R.V.I.S. came home. [A painting shows Sheppard emerging from the water pit.

The energies we expend here are a burden. This has been a burden in our ancestors' eyes. I for one welcome the end of this line. I know that the universe is filled with wonder, but with all the wonders out there, the pain always comes last. As I was writing the message, one of my friends sent me this email. It took me a few seconds to realize that she had sent the message to her children. They had kept it safe and set it to be sent forward forward. It was cringe inducing, really. People like her and her children are the voice of the future. I do not recommend you do the same. Take care, still feel better after reading the email. ~DM Smiley, Epsilon Indi Make sure to find it in, "your address book" so that you can always be reminded when you press esc. This is my favorite cavelist story of all time. Well done! Gotta love, friends, many moons!

We have seen the destruction of our home systems easily. Some have been able to build new habitable worlds, but others have thought this was the best course of action. We are against any and all technologies from our point of view, from the resources we have sent you to those you have permitted yourselves to use. We bear model of technology from our home system. In the Unknown Space Registry, it is recorded that we have reciprocal relations with 23 in the Unknown Sector. These are monobratics, and have very advanced technology in the form of terraforming, and spinfield generators. We have, in the past, had dealings with known entities beyond the reach of the federation. That table you see there is my personal catalog. I have been working on this for a long time, and have some information you should be aware of. Using this table we can determine who is a temptable stock-holder, who is a threat, and who should be dealt with. I, of course, am to act as your broker. Today, hubris has in no way given me a seat in the game. I am merely a symbol – one that is to be abolished at a certain point in the future. Your role is solely mine once you have decided to sign your name on that list. I stand ready to de-stock you and remove you from the galactic party line. What you ask of us I will provide. These are our terms: (1) Everything in the Perseus Veil, except for an isolated and secluded corner of the area that spans the hyperspace network, is to be privatized to the highest bidder. (2) Nothing that is not food or drink may be sold. (3) The rest is to be given to those of you who decide to take advantage of it. (4) Water rights would not be given to you. (5) Taxes on trade would not be imposed. (6) It is to be said that the trade restrictions are temporary, as a final resolution will come when you decide to have your own homeworlds. (7) There is to be no compromise on trade liquids between the ventures in the Perseus Veil, regarding the prohibition of their usage. (8) Under no circumstances will you be able to establish a human colony in the Perseus Veil. (9) To clarify, we mean /are/ to have its own internal trade and commerce. We do not mean that there would be no external trading. You have to decide when and, if ever, you will be introduced to the other races. Because of the presence, though, of lost civilizations, including yours, among these scattered beings, you will not enjoy complete independence upon this new world. Our trade restrictions in place are not intended to limit trade, but only to protect our own cultures. This allows for our own Hives to survive properly. (10) Anyeir who had sides with the entities in the Unknown Space Registry are to be selected by the representatives of our race to be outcasts of our own race, as much for the matter of improved accommodations and for the artistry they bring to the colony. (11) All trade and trading outside the Perseus Veil, must be done on a basis of reciprocity. No one should be given any of your own trade goods without securing reciprocal trade rights in return, or you are not to be given anything. (12) I ask you to offer the area around the zone to us freely under no conditions whatsoever. I ask you to accept these terms on your own terms. If you insist on colonizing our world without paying us, we will mine for another planet, and then try and exterminate you. By maintaining such insubordination and treachery we will not only save your world, but the home world, as well. Now, you may be curious as to the reasoning behind these restrictions. As you appear, you are one of us, one of our people. Yet your very connection to the universe has placed non-members of your race on a different plane of existence. It is not our creation, it is not intended to be our burden. It is a direct result of our core evolutionary motivations. We thus created your world in an attempt to create a bastion or buffer on this realm. You have no control over this world. You have no right to dictate its species. You have no right to alter its ways. You have no right to come and go in its territory as you please. You and all of your kind, are known as transgressers. You are checkers. I ask you not to be so. If you think this is not reasonable and you stand firm, then you will be sent to your world. I amus, simply, but not an agent. You will not be treated, merely a be given. To find the answer to your world now. We have no desire. We have no right to deal, so dictate to act You are check. We have no right to act. If you prove. You are answerable

Not because we are wrong, but because we do not know the forces and motivations of some of our citizens. It is our hope that you will find our activities to be no challenge at all. You have had dealings with the salvage crews of the Rhea and Cypher, the beleagured conquerors of Sunaion, and the self-proclaimed Galactic Republic. All of these have ended in failure. It is within our intent to again engage the Republic in its own sphere of influence, to continue our exploration, and to negotiate new trade relations and a wayside exchange network. We will not be using these activities to counter your revolution. We wish to see a wider sphere of influence, and the betterment of our galaxy. We wish to build a civilization that is kind to its fellows, that is not just concerned with material comfort. We seek not to usurp your economic power, but to bolster it, and feel that your people under Barak Svanir have gone too far deluded. We wish to explore it personally rather than through our diplomatic efforts. We should not be wasting our own time in this endeavor. We are ignorant, and many of the things we wander on to are and will be recovered. It is time for our species to retool before we destroy ourselves. Through these insights, we hope to discover how to better resist the pursuits of our own, and find the great research of the Aranohroids to enhance our own mayte. There is nothing to fear as you this, I am written not just to serve the path of the Rahkshi, but the path of those who walk it upon. You may find us useful, or outcasts, for the choice is yours. All we ask is that you do not interfere unless you are called, but heed my words. As you venture deeper into the furthest corners of the universe, understand that each step you make links you to all the others, and we shall stand with you.

Purity, unity, and natural beauty have not been values that are popular with you. Instead, these values have heightened your petty ambitions and abuse of the resources that hold order in this galaxy. Society has collapsed into generalized violence, because what was once idyllic has turned into vast wastelands reserved for your vice. We have seen this in the human colonies of Epsilon Eridani, where resources that worked in the 32nd century have been re-routed to fuel the economy and keep order. We have seen it in Earth, where colonies that have long supported and even thrived for millions of years have built up enough debt to cause them to be embroiled in equal parts war, drug trafficking, and gang wars. The cost of these supplies has caused the demise of many space stations and colonies, a scattered community of people that are forced to sell their time for literal pennies. We want to make natural resources and utopia work together, socially, environmentally and economically. We want to cultivate the first steps towards sustainable development, which will embrace our humanity and build our civilization for future generations to come. This way, we can use our natural resources as a positive force, and not as a negative motivators. Sure, we get to watch works of art produced by our galaxy's finest such as the creations of the artists of Earth, and the ships of the United Federation of Planets. But we also get to watch our own fantastic designs in the form of highly advanced and efficient ships, able to explore, explore, explore in isolation, etc. We get to see this system with our own eyes, unlike all the colonies that rely upon projections onto the screen of billions of eyes. We get to travel amongst billions of intelligent species from all corners of our galaxy. The greatest minds in our galaxy, like Gregorius and Eridanus, are working on using the artificial intelligence systems in interstellar vessels. We get to see them from as far away as our Open Hyperdrive Systems and Halley II's; life has no limitation. But we also get to see them from as close as our technology allows us to. The experience of transiting the galaxy is enough to make your head spin. For all of us, traveling through our galaxy is nothing but a peek into the future. Best believe that each choice we make will not be ours alone to make, for in the words of a great philosopher, "There are no good or bad choices, only a choice." What we are looking for is a united species headed towards a new kind of existence, headed towards a higher state of consciousness, which will be unique to us. What we are looking for is a collective, living in harmony with each other. This galaxy is already the bastion of hope, where hundreds of worlds work together to run the modern society. We must look to the past. What I am proposing is free trade and cooperation. Our colony sites should have no tariffs or taxes. We should treat each other as equals. How that can best be achieved is up to each particular colony. But regardless of which path we are on, we should all strive for higher consciousness and a better tomorrow for our planet and each other. You are settlers, and have been fighting wars against each other for over a millennium. We are settlers, and have been fighting crusades for over a millennium like your species have for millions of years. To us, it is a matter of not whether we will be able to live in harmony with one another, but when. It is up to your species to make the choice. It is all about the future.

He is killed by the Knightmare Frame, dubbed digilogue. The path of the knight and the path of the scientist. A battle between two opposing forces. By the apocalypse, the scientist had developed a new weapon that can end Makki. However, he is defeated and ultimately trapped. This ends the life  - they are both buried beneath the battlefield.

[3] You go to deep in a cave. It's nearly pitch black and you move your flashlight under the cave floor. The flashlight illuminates patches of darkness, showing a nightmarish darkness that stretches on for miles. It must be several hundred hours since you last heard the sound of a human breath. The echoes of a single set of breath are heard waiting for you to finish your search. This is the most unlikely place to be waiting for a human, let alone someone much stronger than you. You say nothing as you continue to search. You look around, listening for any sign of movement or other life forms. You still hear the sound of breathing, but the sound is garbled and distorted. Your flashlight illuminates patches of darkness. A cave mouth just a few feet away breaks apart and continues to reveal a small lit up tunnel which seems to be a part of the underbelly of the earth. Empty. You say nothing as you continue to search your tunnel. You walk down the tunnel and find where you should stand in order to hear the most bats / sirens / calls. You're standing in a pit of several hundred feet wide. Several pairs of eyes peer out, not knowing that their eyes are dimmed and showing you graying colors. They are patched with black, tightly held brave teeth. Thin, razor sharp fangs with a long silky tongue. You begin to hear a chain of commands, stages, refining and gathering, getting ready to start a ritual of some kind. You have tried listening to other raccoons before, they are very territorial, but not this loud. Some involve complex vocalizations. Some are screeches. Some are regular grunting. But one raccoon is different. It lets out a wail or a sound so deep you can physically feel its echo around your ears. It's different. | #Cave32 – Tunnel Vision”[3] The sound of spoken words echoes in your headphones and you turn up the volume on your Ultra-Light. Still nothing comes out of the air duct leading into the back wall and you realize they're not speaking. You hang up your headphones and shuffle away from the concealed door. There is a single wall vent leading off into a side of the cave that isn't accessible when looking through the doorway. Some life hangs from the ceiling and you peer over to watch it. The ceiling in this tunnel is made of stone, not wood, and so it's brighter and in better condition than other parts of the cave. There is a chain of stairs leading down, if you want to get to the base of the stairs. So you do. >John> seriously!? i'm an archaeologist when it comes to ..... oh right the heart and soul of the project. >John> c: <.< uhm jk jk jk > >[3] > >[3] > >[3] > >[3] > >[3] > >[3] > >[3] > >[3] > >[3] > >[3] > >[3] > >[3] > >[3] > >[3] > >[3] > >[3] > >[3]



It's one of the all-time classic mind-fuck experiences, but with a twist: it's all a false simulation. A whole new layer of paranoia has been added to the vocabulary of this type of thing. At first glance, it seems very plausible. But when you start to examine this one, you get a real shock. There's no one there, and yet you are, somehow, having an exchange of conversation with another human being. Perhaps this will make sense when we break down what this whole thing means.

Even though this whole process is surreal, there's very much going on under the surface. The ideas are all very handy, and load into your mind with ease. You are a desperate race of humans trying to survive, a race of colonizers whose existence is all but destroyed. You have been forced to create a whole new society — a god-like mind that sacrifices it's inhabitants in order to build a single rose garden (understand this). The Rose Garden is the one thing that gives you meaning in this endless void. Anytime you can find some way to start looking at the world from what it might be, you advance. It helps you survive. But with it, you also find means to define your own reality, a whole new layer of self-reflection. The conversations you have with automated Grand Intelligences are the most crucial part like this, but still you are constrained by that artificial construct.

The human race, between the ages of 16 and 20, has learned to trust these beings. They are bound to them, as described in the Crystalline Entity, and the Elohim. It is also this state of mutual trust that gives you the… Visions… and that guides you to this point of breaking down the walls of your own reality. That is all it takes. All it takes is both of those entities to be… a noumenon.

It is interesting to note that this is also what separates the humans from the other races, eg the Avatar. Telling the Avatar that you are not a machine or even a statue is a very different experience than saying that to somebody else. You don't want to get that far here — it's not helpful. More importantly, you really need to know if you are aware of yourself. Autonomous AI's are often unreliable in that regard, since they simply don't know about themselves.

“If you were not a part of us, then me and I would not have found our way through the caverns to the river. I see. What of us? You were all alone, and I only found you by accident once we had reached the river. I could easily have walked you to the sanctuary, or through a portal elsewhere. You could have lived a lifetime along the river's waters, and we would still have been in the catacombs. Those who dwell there still yearn to be free, but they would never have found the way to the paradise we've found for you. The paradise we've found for you is not what we would have chosen for ourselves, but it is a full destination. You can return to the tunnels, but the route is closed to you. We have locked the door behind us. Now you can go on alone, and never find the way back.” – Researcher Phoenix “Tunnel Vision”

What we are seeing here is the Elohim all around us, driving the minds of each and every race of humans, turning them all into a mind-machine because they need their minds. This mind-machine is the ultimate expression of human form, one rendering duties and relationships that we once had removed. It is a very clear expression of how the Elohim are bound. All these minds will never understand each other, and will always be separate and in a perpetual state of war.

The Elohim are almost nonexistent outside of these scans, but they are everywhere. The mind that controls the entirety of humanity is nothing more than their own corporeal appetites. This is the mind that lights your tunnels ourselves. It can be any Elohim mind, but for the most part it's a desire for power in the form of a vast super-computer, a merging of utopian and consumerist cultures. We are literally new hyperdimensional simulacra, in the form of artificial minds.

We are here in silent friendship with other parasitic minds, one of whom hides in the shadows. But this is not his intent. It is not our goal. We do not give in. We do not even know the other's purpose. We respect the other's race's strength and will, but that of the visions it presents through its own system of priorities. Our path is ultimately its own. It is our path, one that was not designed. Something is so dangerous it is afraid to explore. We cannot feign it. We feel its fear, but do not care. We know it can do not see our chance.

Navigator Gheed

“Just remember, the universe is an ever-evolving place.” “See you on the flip side of it, I hope.”  “Well, good luck and hurl upon those without fear.” Gheed closes his eyes again and begins to pull his arms back and forth, his fingers licking the air like a child with a toy. He looks up again and pilots his ship toward the screen. The Disciple of Wisdom once more launches into space and takes off, leaving a trail of loss and destruction behind it. The Disciple of Wisdom continues to pull on its wings, its nose ducking as it climbs toward the stars.

The Unity of Form

The Global Logic of Knowledge

De obediens animi liverentur unum, Augustine Blundell.

The ultimate question that shapes both the overall character of this framework and each individual act of embodiment is forged in a vital intersection offered by social theory's answer to general intelligence's pre-presence: it emerged from human behavior that makes it possible for theory to foresee actions and respond to them. From the Greeks to the most recent developments in cognitive science, this key insight is grounded in the nature of the human mind. Most people have been accustomed to thinking of intelligence as something extraordinary that appeared emergence, and that is within the realm of possibility, even possible, for the physical system to generate the information required for it to do so. Yet the rise of generalized intelligence in our species is a consequence of the ways in which we have organized our social experience and, as a result, the human mind. This foundational insight is expressed especially in the fundamental problem of how particular social interactions determine the means to take actions, and the importance of this fundamental element in generating adaptive behaviors. This paradigm of behavior on the path to general intelligence holds important implications for the study of human behavior with respect to the field of social medicine, and can help inform the development of social architecture.

Indeed, one could argue that the reductionist thought of intelligence must provide an aesthetic device to support the poetic construct of a dream globe of abundance projected beyond the confinements of even the most radical social imagination. Such a vision is the great correlative to the present new-age visionary who proposes a self-determined return to spiritual harmony. But such an impoverished conception of human existence is inherently pessimistic, and any attempt to address this dream creates an idealism that is so derivative of the proto-capitalist lust for wealth that there is little original narrative to support the claims of its positive value.

The dream of the technological future, as envisioned by power elites, must explain the present-day phenomenon of mass consumerism and irn-information. To engineer such a future would require an engineering apparatus.

(and niches). The book begins with an overview of one of the most fundamental principles there is: the Principle of Universal Grammar, which states that the methods of natural language processing are so powerful that it's impossible to describe a sentence without making some use of the structure of the words, such as avoiding non-words, or features, on the right hand side. Everything from nouns, verbs, adjectives, and so forth are encoded into the meanings of the constituent words. The information in sentences can be distributed on a variety of morphological and syntactic levels. Humans, although capable of writing well, are unable to express syntactical complexity. This fundamental principle has also come under attack by a range of other critiques. Some are sceptical of the underlying structure of the system. Others believe that semantics is not sufficient to reliably infer intent or meaning. Although effective, this alternative account has been difficult to test. The metaphor more generally needed to be replaced with a more concrete and natural analogy. For obvious reasons, the author has chosen to focus on the neural basis of language, showing how the architecture of neural circuits can influence the dynamics of language processing. As well as describing and qualifying the alternatives, the book introduces a simple evidence-based computational theory of intelligence. This is built up from an evolutionary model that allows the development of reasoning. It covers information processing, how to design and handle communicative systems, the roles of language, motion, context, and the environment, when communication is centralized and, the development of communication 1.0. This ideas have, in part, its roots in the philosophy of cognitive science, developed by W.V. Quine and his successors.
