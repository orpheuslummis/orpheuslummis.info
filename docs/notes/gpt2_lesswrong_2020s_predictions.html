<p>What follows is a selected subset of samples from <em>stock</em> GPT-2 1558M when given predictions for the 2020s from <a href="https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/uYMy2vvJtsxQ4Fdow/2020-s-prediction-thread">this LessWrong thread</a>.</p>
<p>This is just for ‘fun’, as you’ll see that GPT-2’s output is quite random.</p>
<p>Note that I’ve put one ‘prediction’ per line for readability and removed repetitive or meaningless output. I’ve compiled the predictions from the thread into <a href="https://orpheuslummis.info/notes/lesswrong_2020s_predictions.html">this note</a> and used ~1024-word subsets of it as prompts.</p>

<p>If you believe this, then you should start to prepare now. “The Internet is like a monkey’s hand. It is impossible to understand how you use it in the same way you would if you were designing a helicopter or a plane. You can’t design a human-machine interface that works the same way. It’s almost impossible to imagine a future based on machine intelligence that is any more human-like than the one we have now.”[1]</p>
<p>Mr. Diamandis warns that the machine vision of abundantly illustrated by the time machine mind-reading Nervous Project could become the reality, and treat us as machines: “the good, sustainable robots” we could just be going to have to begin to send them the machines to wipe out the human population in the current world of a few decades instead of time.</p>

<p>It’s fine to be skeptical of AGI and the dangers it may pose &gt; but you gotta be on board with a framework that justifies that skepticism. &gt; I don’t think so. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The most likely scenario is that we will avoid a catastrophe and &gt; stick with a path where the global population stays stable. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; AGI is something that only small groups of people have the resources to &gt; fund on a large scale. Thus I think it unlikely that we would have &gt; a global catastrophe. If that’s the case, then the whole AGI &gt; debate is highly misguided. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The likelihood of a catastrophe is large enough that I think &gt; it’s worth thinking through the various risks. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; One threat that I see is a sort of “American middle class X” effect. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The middle class X is where most of the people who are not in the &gt; top 100% of income earners are. If you cut that off, you would &gt; have a large number of people in the bottom 99% of income &gt; earners who would be poor. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This is extreme, but there is an “indicator problem” that exists &gt; for people of various income groups. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; This indicator problem is that by the time the middle class X becomes &gt; in decline, you could have many millions of people who are &gt; substantially poor. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; It’s also worth pointing out that there are large numbers of people in every &gt; income group who only have one or two huge assets. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; So if you think that AGI is a certainty, you also have to address &gt; some very large numbers of people whose net worth is very &gt; volatile and whose assets are not very stable (think heirs to &gt; large fortunes). &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; The idea of existential risk is relatively new to me, so my approach &gt; is somewhat different. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think that we could avoid the worst-case scenario by having a &gt; global governance scheme to regulate in terms of a global population. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; But if you think that AGI is a certainty, you agree with me that &gt; AGI will cause the whole thing to collapse. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think that you should be a little more even-handed in your treatment of &gt; the risks. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; For instance, I agree that AI risks will be a problem with AGI but I think they are different problems. &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; I think that you can make a case that AGI emphasize a scenario in which a collision is inevitable, one where a country is so crippled by an AI that it cannot make any progress while it still has a population and &gt; in which it’s economy is up to 3/4 times as much worse off Earth so that you cannot find a solution. &gt; &gt; It’s still possible but things like a lot less than likely. &gt; than a one in which you need to use the original population &gt; I think you can let alone find possible in which in which a situation where an’Some ofI want to change the solution in which fast in which set enough remain really succeeds in a relatively where in puts directly &gt; quite As well I know I think that“2013-The ’I we start With-45 &gt;in some.

<p>There is no meaningful evidence that people will adopt AGI. 2.2% Then follow up questions: What would your strategy be for building a working AGI? What would be the main characteristics of a working AGI that you expect to see? What is the average amount of time that you think it will take for an AGI to be sufficiently reliable that it will make significant contributions to human society in spite of many failures? If you are working on general artificial intelligence, what would be its main characteristics? How do you think people will respond to an artificial general intelligence, and how will that response differ from the response of humans to individual human creations? This section is split into the following four subcategories: 1. Data, time, and high-level problems 2. Decision, planning, and decision-making 3. Human/AI interaction 4. Underexplained questions If you are working on general artificial intelligence, what is its main characteristic? What is the average amount of time it will take for an AGI to be sufficiently reliable that it will make significant contributions to human society in spite of many failures? Now, if we’re talking about AGI as it relates to the above questions, then there are a few things to keep in mind. First, AGI will not be exactly like some sort of superintelligence. Instead, it will be something quite different. Working toward AGI will include achieving its primary and secondary goals. This means that assuming that an AGI could accomplish those goals, it will have a different set of strengths and weaknesses than what we can see with our current capabilities today. Second, it’s difficult to predict what the human response to an AGI will be. That’s because AGI isn’t necessarily the same as a superintelligence, and there are always going to be several factors that contribute to the human reaction. That said, it’s reasonable to expect that it will be a lot more than we can currently imagine . Third, there are a few potential additional considerations that we haven’t addressed here. They include the following: the following: 1. How would an AGI look, an likely to advance? First, the first great potential, the great future.

<p>“The fourth transformation is the most fundamental because it affects our very way of being on the planet. It’s about the management and control of our operations and the environment within which they occur.” ~ Timothy C. Wirth, Professor of Pervasive Computing and Director of the Center for the Study of Existential Risk at the University of Southern California</p>
<p>The fourth transformation, the “control and management of operations and the environment within which they occur”, has enormous implications for mankind’s future. In a recent Singularity University chat, Singularity University founder and CEO, Ray Kurzweil, noted that “our lives have been around for thousands of years and because we have been able to communicate and share information faster than any other species, we’ve managed to avoid becoming a mere biological species.” As technology continues to advance at exponential rates, humanity will be faced with a multitude of challenges, with the fourth transformation representing one of the most perilous.</p>

<p>Governments will be able to deny people access to all information and services. 70%</p>
<p>Privacy and civil liberties will continue to be severely constrained by law. 100%</p>
<p>Governments will be able to track and profile people for their own purposes. 100%</p>
<p>The Internet will evolve into a highly concentrated, centrally controlled, surveillance state</p>
<p>Robust AI will be so powerful relative to humans that humans will not be able to respond to it. 98%</p>
<p>There will be no serious effort to make humans more sociable by any humans (including AI) even in the next 30 years. ~80%</p>
<p>We can expect a 25% increase in the average IQ of the population in the next 30 years. ~100%</p>
<p>Our first cross-cousin marriages will be between human and superintelligent AI. 95%</p>
<p>The first “smart” child will be a GM child, developed by an AI. n/a</p>
<p>So why do I suggest an average IQ increase of 40 points?</p>
<p>Remember, the above are all just plain-old-historical estimates. They may very well be wrong. There are various ways to get “correction” on IQ. Open subfields of IQ are entirely incompatible with each other. Instead, I propose that the areas which are “incompatible” (IQ + G) must overlap in time. If a subfield of IQ is co-joined by a subfield of AGI, then it is possible that if the two subfields succeeded in interfacing, then the subfield of AGI would have a substantially higher IQ than the subfield of IQ. If this is true, then the subfields of AGI may have an IQ of 10 or more while the subfields of IQ are likely to have IQs of 4 to 8.</p>
<p>Let’s look at the subfields we can converged on:</p>
<p>I propose the following:</p>
<p>Eliminate AD (Asset Dependence) and improve SAT (Scholastic aptitude) Narrow the IQ of AGI by promoting gut self-selection into higher-IQ subfields like AGI + Superintelligence I propose a subfield of AGI to overlap with the subfield of IQ AGI – first attempt at a self-modifying AI, then into a superintelligence This could be an AI with the IQ of AGI, or higher.</p>
<p>So the subfields which overlap with AGI have subfields of IQs superior to AGI. The subfields of AGI and IQ are likely to be much less intelligent than AGI, and much less capable than AGI. So AGI.</p>
